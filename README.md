Hi, I am currently studying at Deltion College in Zwolle, Netherlands. My main interests are software development and automating systems. My passion for computer systems and software creation started at a young age.

Before starting my studies, I had experience with computer hardware as well. I am highly motivated and possess a talent for problem-solving and creating efficient software solutions.

My goal after graduation is to find an exciting and challenging company where I can further develop my skills and continue to grow in the industry.
