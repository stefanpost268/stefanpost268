# About Me

Hi, I am currently studying at HBO Windesheim in Zwolle, Netherlands.

## Background

My passion for computer systems and software development began at a young age. I've always been fascinated by technology, and I'm particularly drawn to automating systems and creating efficient software solutions. Before starting my current program, I also gained valuable experience working with computer hardware.

## Goals

My goal is to find an exciting and challenging company where I can further develop my skills, contribute to innovative projects, and continue to grow in the software development industry.
